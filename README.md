# VespaRobotics 2025/2026 Auto-APT repo

Welcome to the **VespaRobotics Auto-APT Repository**!  
This repo is dedicated to developing and testing autonomous systems for the **2025 - 2026 FRC season**.  

(AKA: this is where l1f3 tries to organize all his ideas for auto systems… lol)

---

## 📌 Purpose
- Experiment with new autonomous programming techniques.  
- Prototype and test auto paths (APT = Auto Path Testing) (or April tags).  
- Keep track of concepts, code snippets, and strategies for competition.  

---

## 🛠 Tech & Tools
- **FRC WPILib** (Java depending on project branch).  
- Path planning & simulation tools.  
- GitHub for version control & organization.  

---

## 📂 Repo Structure
- `src/` → Code experiments & prototypes.  
- `docs/` → Notes, planning, and diagrams.  
- `tests/` → Simulation + verification code.  

---

## ✅ Goals for 2025/2026
- [ ] Implement reliable path planning.  
- [ ] Test multiple autonomous routines.  
- [ ] Integrate vision targeting.  
- [ ] Ensure auto code is competition-ready.
